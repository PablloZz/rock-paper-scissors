# Rock Paper Scissors Game
Rock paper scissors is a game played between two or more players. In
this game, each player simultaneously chooses either rock, paper, or
scissors:

- Rock beats scissors;
- Paper beats rock;
- Scissors beats paper;

The objective of the game is to outsmart your opponent by choosing the
winning gesture. The winner of each round earns one point.

This project aimed to consolidate my basic JavaScript knowledge,
focusing on concepts such as:

- Usage if functions;
- Implementing loops;
- Correct usage of loops;
- Enhancing problem solving skills.

By working on this project, I aim to gain experience in applying these
concepts in practice and improve my understanding of the language.
