# Rock Paper Scissors Game
Rock paper scissors is a game played between two or more players. In
this game, each player simultaneously chooses either rock, paper or
scissors:

- Rock beats scissors;
- Paper beats rock;
- Scissors beats paper;

The objective of the game is to outsmart your opponent by choosing the
winning gesture. The winner of each round earns one point.
